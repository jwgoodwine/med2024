\section{CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK}
\label{sec:conclusions}

This paper presents a neural network that is trained on integer order step
responses and predicts with surprising accuracy the order of fractional order
step responses. Figure~\ref{fig:accuracy} illustrates the accuracy of the
fractional order predictions with nearly every fractional step input identified
with an order that places it very close to the exact line that would run from
the point $(1,1)$ to $(2,2)$. 

While the network predicts fractional orders very well for fractional orders
\emph{between} the trained orders of 1 and 2, it does a poor job extrapolating
outside of the range $[1,2]$, as is illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:extrapolate}
where the range of fractional values was extended only by 5\% in at each end, to
$\left[ 0.95, 2.05 \right]$. Clearly it is particularly inaccurate for orders
above 2. In our judgment it seems that this network is exceptionally good at
``interpolation'' and surprisingly bad at ``extrapolation''. The reason for this
is currently not clear and part of our current efforts. Clearly, values very far
outside the training set will not be modeled by the network very well, but this
network is striking to us in this regard.  Of course, fractional order step
responses for orders above 2 are unstable (although not growing excessively in
the time range considered), and has a qualitative difference from the rest of
the training data. However,  the extreme change in predicted order that is
observed is, for us, unexpected. 

There are several avenues for continued research. Currently the network only
identifies first order, second order and fractional orders between one and two
step responses. While it does it remarkably accurately, it only applies to
equations of the type represented by Equation~\ref{eq:fracstep}. Many fractional
order systems may have multiple fractional derivative terms and also orders
outside the range of $[1,2]$. With regard to the latter limitation, we have not
yet tried the rather obvious approach of adding zeroth order step responses to
the system, which would themselves be step functions. These would seem to lack
diversity of dynamics to warrant having a third of the training set be them and
careful design of the training set and approach would be needed.

This network simply identified fractional orders, albeit very accurately. A much
more challening problem, stemming from our large scale network work, is to
distinguish fractional order responses with second order responses with complex
roots. In many of our networks considered in
\cite{goodwinemed2023,goodwinemmar2023}, the difference between the accuracy of
a fractional order model and second order model was fairly small. In such cases
a neural network would be tasked with identifying much more subtle differences
between integer and fractional order responses.
