\section{CONCLUSIONS}
\label{sec:conclusions}

This paper presents a neural network that is trained on integer order step
responses and predicts with surprising accuracy the order of fractional order
step responses. Figure~\ref{fig:accuracy} illustrates the accuracy of the
fractional order predictions with nearly every fractional step input identified
with an order that places it very close to the exact line that would run from
the point $(1,1)$ to $(2,2)$. While the network predicts fractional orders
very well for fractional orders \emph{between} the trained orders of 1 and 2, it
does a poor job extrapolating outside of the range $[1,2]$, as is illustrated in
Figure~\ref{fig:extrapolate}.
