\section{Using the Integer Trained Network on Fractional Order Step Responses}

Now we give a fractional order step response to the trained neural network to
see if it can generalize the training on first and second order transfer
functions to fractional order step responses. As indicated above, we use the
\texttt{numfracpy} python library to numerically compute the fractional order
step response for time from 0 to 10. The solution is numerically computed with a
time step of $\Delta t = 0.01$, but the input to the nextwork is 101 nodes, so
only every 10th element of the numerical solution is used.

We tested the network on 1000 fractional order step responses to transfer
functions of the form
\[
X(s) = \frac{k}{s^\alpha + k} \frac{1}{s},
\]
or in the time domain
\begin{equation}
\frac{\d^\alpha x}{\d t^\alpha}(t) + k x(t) = k
\label{eq:fracstep}
\end{equation}
with zero initial conditions. 

The 1000 responses were each generated and tested as follows: 
\begin{itemize}
\item Randomly select an order between 1 and 2 from a uniform distribution.
\item Randomly select a $k$ between 5 and 9 from a uniform distribution.
\item Numerically compute the step response to Equation~\ref{eq:fracstep} using
the \texttt{FODE()} function from the \texttt{numfracpy} library. 
\end{itemize}

\section{CONCLUSIONS}

A conclusion section is not required. Although a conclusion may review the main
points of the paper, do not replicate the abstract as the conclusion. A
conclusion might elaborate on the importance of the work or suggest applications
and extensions.
