\section{USING THE INTEGER TRAINED NETWORK ON FRACTIONAL ORDER STEP RESPONSES}
\label{sec:generalize}

Now we give a fractional order step response to the trained neural network to
see if it can generalize the training on first and second order transfer
functions to fractional order step responses. As indicated above, we use the
\texttt{numfracpy} python library to numerically compute the fractional order
step response for time from 0 to 10. The solution is numerically computed with a
time step of $\Delta t = 0.01$, but the input to the network is 101 nodes, so
only every 10th element of the numerical solution is used.

We tested the network on 1000 fractional order step responses to transfer
functions of the form
\[
  X(s) = \left( \frac{k}{s^\alpha + k} \right) \left( \frac{1}{s} \right),
\]
or in the time domain
\begin{equation}
\frac{\d^\alpha x}{\d t^\alpha}(t) + k x(t) = k
\label{eq:fracstep}
\end{equation}
with zero initial conditions. 

The 1000 responses were each generated and tested as follows: 
\begin{itemize}
\item Randomly select an order between 1 and 2 from a uniform distribution.
\item Randomly select a $k$ between 5 and 9 from a uniform distribution. This
  range of values was selected to produce responses with a period of oscillation
  similar to the natural frequencies in the training set.
\item Numerically compute the step response to Equation~\ref{eq:fracstep} using
the \texttt{FODE()} function from the \texttt{numfracpy} library. 
\end{itemize}

Each of the 1000 fractional order step responses was interpolated or sampled
into time steps of $\Delta t = 0.1$, and those points were applied to the input
layer of the neural network trained on the integer order data. The results are
illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:accuracy}, illustrating an excellent match. The
mean square error for the data is 0.00121 with $R^2 = 0.9897$.
