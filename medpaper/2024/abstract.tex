  This paper presents a standard feed forward artificial neural network that
    identifies the order of the dynamics of a unit step response. The system is
    trained on only first and second order systems, yet identifies fractional
    order responses with a high degree of accuracy. The details of the
    structure of the neural network, the training method and the training sets,
    as well as statistics describing the accuracy of the fractional predictions
    are presented. Also using the neural network to identify fractional
    dynamics for a large scale networked system from the authors' prior work is
    presented as further validation and a demonstration of the applicability of
    the results.  This demonstrates the potential for practicing engineers to
    use similar machine learning tools trained on ``standard'' systems with the
    ability to distinguish when features such as fractional order dynamics are
    significant and warrant deeper consideration for the design or control of
    such a system.
