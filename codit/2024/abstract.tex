  This paper presents a standard feed forward artificial neural network that
  identifies the order of the dynamics of a unit step response. The main
  contribution of this paper is the demonstration that a system that is trained
  on only integer order, first and second order systems, can identify fractional
  order responses with a high degree of accuracy. The details of the design of
  structure of the neural network, the training method and the training sets, as
  well as statistics describing the accuracy of the fractional predictions are
  presented. Also using the neural network to identify fractional dynamics for a
  large scale networked system from the authors' prior work is presented as
  further validation and a demonstration of the applicability of the results.
  This demonstrates the potential for practicing engineers to use similar
  machine learning tools trained on ``standard'' systems with the ability to
  distinguish when features such as fractional order dynamics are significant
  and warrant deeper consideration for the design or control of such a system.
